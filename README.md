# 🗂️ Logs Archiver Script

This Bash script compresses a given log directory into a `.tar.gz` archive and stores the archive in a **hardcoded output directory** named `log_backups`. The output directory is automatically created if it doesn't exist.

---

## 📌 Features

- Accepts a log directory as input
- Automatically generates archive names based on the current date and time
- Creates the output directory (`log_backups`) if it doesn't exist
- Stores all archives neatly in one place
- Displays user-friendly status messages

---

## 🚀 Usage

### 📁 1. Give executable permission

```bash
chmod +x Logs_archiver.sh
```

### 🛠️ 2. Run the script

```bash
./Logs_archiver.sh /path/to/your/logs
```

📌 Replace `/path/to/your/logs` with the actual directory you want to compress.

---

## 📦 Output

- Archives will be stored inside the `log_backups` directory located in the current working directory.
- The archive name format is:  
  ```
  logs_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.tar.gz
  ```

Example:
```bash
log_backups/logs_20250405_143025.tar.gz
```

---

## 🧪 Sample Output

```bash
📁 Output directory 'log_backups' does not exist. Creating it...
📦 Compressing '/var/log' into 'log_backups/logs_20250405_143025.tar.gz'...
✅ Archive created successfully at: log_backups/logs_20250405_143025.tar.gz
```

---

## ❗ Error Handling

- If no directory is passed:
  ```bash
  ❌ Usage: ./Logs_archiver.sh <log-directory>
  ```
- If the input directory doesn't exist:
  ```bash
  ❌ Logs directory '/path/to/logs' does not exist.
  ```
- If output directory creation fails:
  ```bash
  ❌ Failed to create output directory.
  ```
